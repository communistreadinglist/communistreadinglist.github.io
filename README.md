### why?
This is a reading list that was collectively made by Communists and Historians which is aimed to be the best possible regarding the following aspects:
1. The common bases of Communism: what does this mean? There are many lines of communist though (Example: Maoism is considered to be a line of communist that builds on Marxist-Leninist thought), but this reading list should have most of the common bases between all of them (except some weird and maybe revisionist sects)
   
2. Difficulty Level: All the texts are ordered by difficulty level in a manner where concepts are more easily digestible as you move through it
   
3. Being a starting point: This is a list that serves as a base in Marxist though, it's meant to be re-read and more importantly, added to: feel free to, when reading, complement it with other Marxist texts!


‚ö†Ô∏è Underneath is Aditional Bibliography that is incredibly dense and **CONSULTATIONAL**, _**DO NOT attempt to read these cover to cover!**_

‚ö†Ô∏è  If someone told you to start with Capital **they do not know what they are talking about**, it's not meant to be read in this manner and attempting this will only make you quit reading Marxist texts.
      
‚ö†Ô∏è  Use these to consult specific information when necessary, and preferably only AFTER Reading the 5th item on the list: Value, Price and Profit ; This is because it's the basis of understanding these more complex texts.

### Credits
This reading list is translated and adapted from the list in [this video](https://youtu.be/cg5winGpx80?si=-OeDklUfnC8u7ep6) 
it's an amazing source for understanding the basis of communism, the video has well-translated English Captions despite the audio and on-screen text being entirely in Brazilian Portuguese

I will probably update this with more resources and pages later as I learn to use github pages better, peace.
